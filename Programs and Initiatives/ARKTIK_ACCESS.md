## **Key Principles of ARKTIK ACCESS**

### **1. A Privilege, Not a Right**
- ARKTIK ACCESS is an invitation extended to observers, not an entitlement.
- Access is contingent upon the comfort and agreement of all session participants.

### **2. Respect and Professionalism**
- Observers are expected to maintain the highest standards of etiquette and respect.
- Any disruptive or inappropriate behavior will result in immediate revocation of access.

### **3. Consent-Based Participation**
- The presence of observers requires the unanimous consent of all active participants.
- If any participant expresses discomfort, the observation request will be respectfully declined.

### **4. Non-Participatory Role**
- Observers are strictly non-participatory unless explicitly invited by the facilitator.
- The primary role of an observer is to witness and learn without interrupting the sacred flow of the session.

### **Step 2: Participant Approval**
- Facilitators confidentially consult with all active session participants to ensure unanimous comfort with the observer’s presence.

### **Step 3: Observation Guidelines**
